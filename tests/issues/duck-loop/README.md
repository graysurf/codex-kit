# Duck Loop (Disposable Test Root)

This folder is test-only and disposable.
It exists only for plan-issue-loop validation.
Do not store production code or long-lived artifacts here.

## Execution Profiles

- `per-sprint`: sprint-scoped fixtures such as `sprint1/per-sprint/`.
- `group-shared`: fixtures shared by all tasks in a PR group.
- `group-isolated`: fixtures isolated per task/member in a PR group.
