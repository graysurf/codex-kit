## Steps (Checklist)

Note: Any unchecked checkbox in Step 0–3 must include a Reason (inline `Reason: ...` or a nested `- Reason: ...`) before close-progress-pr can complete. Step 4 is excluded (post-merge / wrap-up).
Note: For intentionally deferred / not-do items in Step 0–3, use `- [ ] ~~like this~~` and include `Reason:`. Unchecked and unstruck items (e.g. `- [ ] foo`) will block close-progress-pr.

- [x] Step 0: [[Alignment / prerequisites]]
  - Work Items:
    - [x] [[work item]]
  - Artifacts:
    - `docs/progress/<YYYYMMDD>_<feature_slug>.md` (this file)
    - [[notes / dataset / commands]]
  - Exit Criteria:
    - [x] Requirements, scope, and acceptance criteria are aligned: [[notes]]
    - [x] Data flow and I/O contract are defined (including DB schema/table, if applicable): [[notes]]
    - [x] Risks, rollback plan, and migration/backfill strategy are defined: [[notes]]
    - [x] Minimal reproducible verification data and commands are defined: [[command + dataset]]
- [x] Step 1: [[Minimum viable output (MVP)]]
  - Work Items:
    - [x] [[work item]]
  - Artifacts:
    - [[artifact paths]]
    - [[docs path]]
  - Exit Criteria:
    - [x] At least one happy path runs end-to-end (CLI/script/API): [[command]]
    - [x] Primary outputs are verifiable (files/DB/progress docs): [[artifact paths]]
    - [x] Usage docs skeleton exists (TL;DR + common commands + I/O contract): [[docs path]]
- [x] Step 2: [[Expansion / integration]]
  - Work Items:
    - [x] [[work item]]
  - Artifacts:
    - [[sql/scripts]]
    - [[notes]]
  - Exit Criteria:
    - [x] Common branches are covered (e.g. overwrite/skip/rerun/error handling): [[cases]]
    - [x] Compatible with existing pipelines and naming conventions (no dataflow breakage): [[notes]]
    - [x] Required migrations / backfill scripts and documentation exist: [[sql/scripts + notes]]
- [x] Step 3: [[Validation / testing]]
  - Work Items:
    - [x] [[work item]]
  - Artifacts:
    - [[test results]]
    - [[logs / evidence]]
  - Exit Criteria:
    - [x] Validation and test commands executed with results recorded: [[commands + results]]
    - [x] Run with real data or representative samples (including failure + rerun after fix): [[basenames + log paths]]
    - [x] Traceable evidence exists (logs, reports, SQL outputs, screenshots, etc.): [[evidence]]
- [ ] Step 4: [[Release / wrap-up]]
  - Work Items:
    - [ ] [[work item]]
  - Artifacts:
    - [[version / changelog / release notes / links]]
  - Exit Criteria:
    - [ ] Versioning and changes recorded: [[version]], [[CHANGELOG]], [[release notes]] (new content at the top)
    - [ ] Release actions completed: [[tag/release/deploy steps]], [[release link]]
    - [ ] Documentation completed and entry points updated (README / docs index links): [[links]]
    - [ ] Cleanup completed (close issues, remove temporary flags/files, set status to DONE): [[notes]]
