# branch	start_point	worktree_name	gh_base
#
# Notes:
# - `branch` should be a full branch name (e.g. feat/...).
# - `start_point` is where the branch is created from (e.g. main, or another branch for stacking).
# - `worktree_name` must be filesystem-safe (recommended: replace "/" with "__").
# - `gh_base` is the PR base branch to use when opening the PR (main for PR1; PR1 branch for PR2).
#
# Example: 2 stacked PRs (Sprint 1, then Sprint 2–4 stacked on Sprint 1)
feat/notifications-sprint1	main	feat__notifications-sprint1	main
feat/notifications-sprint2-4	feat/notifications-sprint1	feat__notifications-sprint2-4	feat/notifications-sprint1
