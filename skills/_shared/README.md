# skills/_shared

Purpose: global shared assets reused across multiple skill categories.

Allowed contents:

- `lib/` (shared code)
- `references/` (shared docs)
- `assets/` (templates, fixtures)
- `python/` (language-specific helpers)

Forbidden:

- `SKILL.md`
- `scripts/`
- `tests/`

Prefer category-level `_shared/` directories before adding new global assets here.
