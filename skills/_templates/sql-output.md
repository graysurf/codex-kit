# SQL Output Template

Use this template for SQL skills.

## Output and clarification rules

- Include the executed SQL in a fenced code block with `sql`.
- Default to displaying 10 rows; always state the total row count.
- Present results as a compact table when helpful, or a brief summary when a table is noisy.
- Do not paste raw outputs over 100 lines; ask whether to export CSV instead.
- When exporting CSV, write to `output/skills/<command>/` at repo root and report the file path in the response.
- If the results are important reference data, export to CSV directly.
- If required schema/table/filters are missing, ask a concise clarification before running SQL.
